 * A Monte Carlo Markov Chain for sampling multi-dimensional values given a
 * log-likelihood function over the sample space.
 *
 * @param logLikelihoodFunc The log-likelihood over the sample space. Potentially unnormalized.
 * @param init Starting point in the sample space.
 * @param burnin Number of samples to throwaway before starting.
 * @param thin Thins the sequence by skipping 'thin' samples each iteration.
 * @param componentwise Whether slices are made independently for each component.
 * @param initStep The initial distance the bounds of the slice are expanded when stepping out.
 * @param stepBase  The order of magnitude by which the step size increases when stepping out.
 *                  I.e. a factor of 1 will keep the step size constant, 2 will double the distance
